Hi! I am Laksh Gupta from India. I have recently completed my Bachelor of Science (Honors) from Ahmedabad University, India, with a major in Physics. 

I use GitHub to host Python pipelines for photometric data analysis.

Currently, I am a research intern with the Astronomy & Astrophysics group at Ahmedabad University under Professor Samyaday Choudhury.
